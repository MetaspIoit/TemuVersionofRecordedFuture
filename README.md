This firefox extension has not been tested in other browsers. There is still a lot of work and development needing to be done with adjusting the UI and pulling in more results to be displayed by the VT API JSON data. 

1. To import and have this working, ensure you put in your virustotal api keys into the background.js file.
2. Visit about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox then click on "load temporary addon" and find the manifest.json file to import.
